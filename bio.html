                    <h2>Hello world</h2>
                </div>
                <p>I wrote those two words in countless different iterations throughout the years and yet they always bring a smile to my face. In a programmer’s world “hello world” is a synonym for spring, a rebirth or renewal, a way to start fresh (and
                    introduce new and exciting bugs!) My interest in computers started quite early, at age of 7 when parents bought me my first very own PC. I couldn’t sleep so I booted it up and without any knowledge of language (I was 7, and PC was
                    set on English) I tried and failed and tried again until I didn’t, and ever since I’ve been hooked.<br><br> Naturally my appetite grew pretty fast and internet bills piled up even faster (time of dial up). Once I’ve had regular internet
                    access my world changed. Anything you want to know – you got it, and I did. Even though I’ve became a bit of social outcast I don’t regret my time spent online. I’ve learned a lot; languages, programming, hardware and electronics,
                    and I’ve seen enough cat pictures to last a lifetime. Today I have a decent knowledge of Java, Python, SQL, web design and IT in general, but the quest for knowledge never ends, every day we learn something, and something I’ve learned
                    in past years is that I need academic background to work on things of importance, projects of the future. I’m currently living in Croatia, a beautiful country with hardworking people that sadly cling onto the past for too long for
                    one reason or another. I wanted to make a future here but at every step I’ve made has been discouraged by corruption, slow and inefficient bureaucracy, nepotism and general unwillingness to look into the future, rather than bicker
                    about long past history. It will get better in time, but I don’t have any more of it. <br> <br> I have a desire to fix broken things. Whether it’s finding bugs in code or uncooperative transistor on a motherboard, in the end, I’ve
                    made something work that didn’t use to. It’s a small accomplishment, but amassed with years, they pile up (just like electronic dump sites). I’m not a fan of today’s hardware consumerism, people throwing away perfectly good hardware
                    that isn’t “next gen” but that’s something that won’t ever change, it’s just like fashion, hardware fashion and I’ve come to accept it. I’ve worked as a web designer, programmer and IT support, officially and unofficially past 10 years
                    and amassed a decent sum of IT experience, experience that will undoubtedly help me with college itinerary.<br> <br> I wish to expand my knowledge and experience by studying at a college befitting 21st century and yours seems like
                    a correct choice. Hopefully in near future I’ll work with/on future technologies that will rapidly expand very soon – Self driving vehicles, improved artificial intelligence (not true AI, that is probably beyond us for now and ethically
                    questionable), virtual & augmented reality. Maybe even carbon nanotubes (probably the defining material of 21st century, once there is a way to mass produce the material cheaply). Truly I cannot say what will pique my interest in future,
                    but I know it’s related to computer science and /or hardware.<br> <br> </p>
